**Portfolio Impact Statement:**  Transformed fragmented Excel reporting across Sales, Finance, and Marketing into a unified, automated reporting system—cutting manual reporting time by 83% (from 12 hours to 2 hours monthly) and preventing $180K+ 3% annual margin leakage through intelligent discount governance.

## 📈 The Business Challange 
AtliQ Hardware's departments operated in silos with disconnected Excel files, creating three critical problems:

1. **No Single Source of Truth:** Sales and Finance teams reported conflicting numbers, eroding stakeholder confidence
2. **Manual Inefficiency:** 12+ hours spent monthly consolidating data across departments
3. **Revenue Risk:** Sales team spent 30+ minutes per discount approval with no margin safeguards, risking 3% margin leakage

**My Role:** Jr. Business & Data Analyst, responsible for requirements gathering, data modeling, report design, and stakeholder alignment.

## 🛠️ Technical Methodology (The "How")
To ensure the solution is robust and scalable, I followed a professional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach:

1. **Data Analysis (Power Query):** Used for automated data cleaning, merging fragmented CSV/Excel exports, and enforcing data types to ensure data integrity. Performed advanced data shaping, including unpivoting, attribute standardization, and merging multi-year datasets to establish a "Single Source of Truth."
2. **Data Modeling:** Built a star-schema-inspired model within Excel to link Sales, Targets, and P&L data efficiently with Power Pivot and DAX. _[Data Model](Data%20Model.jpg)_
3. **Decision Logic:** Built dynamic "What-If" models for discount approvals and project prioritization. _[Scenario Planning Tool for (Discount Approval)](02_Data_Analytics/07_Scenario_planning_Tool_Discouunt_approval.pdf)_
4. **Tabular Report Design:** Eschewed "flashy" visuals in favor of Executive-Standard Tabular Reports. This approach prioritizes data density, precision, and auditability that is critical for Finance and C-Suite stakeholders.
